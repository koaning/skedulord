        <p>This starts a small website with a dashboard of all the jobs. It is easy to find the
            failed job from here and inspect the logs.</p>

        <img src="endres.gif" style="background-color: white;" width="100%">

        <p>The goal of this project is to offer a lightweight method
           of organising log files for jobs that run from the command line.
           It offers a command line app that can be used from <b>cron</b> to help with maintaining an overview. </p>



        <h2 class="h">What does <b>skedulord</b> do?</h2>

        <p>When you run this command a few things happen.</p>

        <div id="termynal2" data-termynal>
            <span data-ty="input">lord run job1 "python goodjob.py"</span>
        </div>

        <ol>
            <li>It will run `python goodjob.py` and it will assume that `job1` is the name that describes the job.</li>
            <li>It will then capture all the stdout that the job produces.</li>
            <li>This will be saved at <span class="green">~/.skedulord/[jobname]/[timestamp].txt</span>.</li>
            <li>Then the job metadata appended to <span class="green">~/.skedulord/heartbeats.jsonl</span>.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>When logfiles are nicely stored it becomes easy to view them. Skedulord offers tools to
            quickly find jobs that failed and locate their logfiles. When combined
            with cron you suddenly get a lot of features that makes running jobs less scary.</p>

        <p>There's some extra settings you can add to a job too.</p>

        <div id="termynal2" data-termynal>
            <span data-ty="input">lord run job1 "python goodjob.py" --retry 3 --wait 5</span>
            <span data-ty="input">lord run job2 "python badjob.py" --retry 5 --wait 60</span>
        </div>

        <p>These jobs will be retried should they fail. The first job will attempt 3 tries in total
            and will wait 5 seconds between each attempt. The second job will attempt 5 tries and wait
            60 seconds between each go.</p>

        <h2 class="h">Skedulord commands.</h2>

        <p>There's some extra helpers in there too.</p>

        <div id="termynal2" data-termynal>
            <span data-ty="input">lord --help</span>
            <span data-ty data-ty-delay="0" class="blob gray">

        </div>

        <h2 class="h">How do I install it?</h2>

        <div id="termynal2" data-termynal>
            <span data-ty="input">pip install skedulord</span>
        </div>

        <h2 class="h">What does skedulord not do?</h2>
        <p>Skedulord does not:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>schedule jobs for you, this is what <span class="green">cron</span> is for</li>
            <li>integrate with your compute services on your behalf</li>
            <li>write your jobs for you</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 class="h">What are the main usecases?</h2>
        <p>Lot's of ETL jobs are plain and simple; you just want to make it easy to find logs
            of jobs that failed. Skedulord adds retry mechanics as well as an overview.
            Once your jobs become highly dependant then you'll need something more elaborate (like <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">airflow</a>).
            There's a barrier to entry and maintenance for those tools though so if you don't need it
            you might prefer this simpler tool.</p>
        <h2 class="h">Food for Thought</h2>
        <p>How you run your ETL jobs depends on the problems that you have. But there are a few things you might like to consider.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You could schedule a cronjob that will sync the local log files to cloud storage for a backup. You could also schedule a job that will ensure that the disk space is kept at bay.</li>
            <li>You could provision cronjobs automatically using ansible. This can be part of you CI/CD pipeline.</li>
            <li>You could consider using the cron server as a scheduling server and running your jobs someplace else.
                Running a docker container can be done in the cloud from the command line.</li>
            <li>You could read the `~/.skedulord/heartbeats` file with pandas if you're interested in analysing.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2 class="h">Tips on Cron</h2>
        <p>Cron documentation can be a bit annoying to find so we've made a small guide here.
            Note that some of the things we mention here depend on your flavor of linux. So your
            milage might vary. That said: you can edit the cron on a VM by typing the command
            `crontab -e`. This will then allow you to write a file in the terminal. There's an
            example of such a file below:</p>
        <div id="termynal2" data-termynal>
            <span data-ty="input">crontab -e</span>
            <span data-ty data-ty-delay="0" class="blob gray modest">
            SHELL=/bin/sh <br>
            PATH=/home/unixuser/.local/bin <br>
            * * * * * lord run test "date >> /tmp/foobar.txt"<br>
            * * * * * lord run job "/usr/bin/python3 /path/job.py"<br>
            </span>
        </div>
        <p>There's a few things that are important to note:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The user that the cron service uses might be different that yours. This means that should not assume
            that settings like paths and environment variables will be placed automatically. These need to be placed
            at the top of the cron file. Depending on your system SHELL needs to be equal to /bin/sh or /bin/bash.</li>
            <li>It makes sense to set the path to the SHELL as well as the user PATH that cron will assume.</li>
            <li>It is certainly a good idea to run a test job that is supposed to append to a file very minute.</li>
            <li>The python path is explicitly mentioned. This can be a good idea since it ensures that you run
                the right packages from the right environment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There's an alternative though.</p>
        <div id="termynal2" data-termynal>
            <span data-ty="input">crontab -e</span>
            <span data-ty data-ty-delay="0" class="blob gray modest">
            SHELL=/bin/bash <br>
            * * * * * /path/to/cron_job.sh<br>
            </span>
            <span data-ty data-ty-delay="0" class="blob gray modest"><br></span>
            <span data-ty="input">cat /path/to/cron_job.sh</span>
            <span data-ty data-ty-delay="0" class="blob gray modest">
                source /path/to/.bash_profile <br>
                lord run download-job "python /path/to/job.py"
            </span>
        </div>
        <p>This might be a nicer idea since it offers you a bit more of an overview. The
        bash shell also contains the logic for dependencies which could also contain environment variables
        and other settings like those that are in .bash_profile.</p>
